                    <h3>My Journey in Technology</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Technology at Eastern Illinois University, building upon my foundation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology. With 3 years of hands-on experience as a Salesforce Developer at Perfaware, I've had the opportunity to explore various Salesforce clouds, particularly specializing in Commerce Cloud and Order Management systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My professional journey has been enriched by working on complex eCommerce solutions, where I've implemented features like Walmart Go Local integration, Future Inventory Reservation, and Backorder Management Solutions. These experiences have given me deep insights into how technology can streamline business operations and enhance customer experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I balance my studies with my role as a Graduate Assistant, where I develop web applications for various university departments using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. I hold certifications in Salesforce B2C Commerce Developer, Salesforce Administrator, and Salesforce AI Associate, and I'm actively expanding my expertise into AWS cloud services.

                <p>
                    In the next five years, I envision myself as a strong leader and accomplished Cloud Solutions Architect, capable of designing and implementing comprehensive multi-cloud strategies that drive business transformation. My goal is to become the bridge between complex technical capabilities and strategic business objectives, helping organizations optimize efficiency and streamline their operations through innovative cloud solutions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I plan to achieve this by continuously expanding my expertise across multiple cloud platforms, with immediate focus on obtaining my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification to complement my existing Salesforce specialization. By combining my deep understanding of Salesforce ecosystems with robust AWS cloud services knowledge, I'll be positioned to architect hybrid solutions that leverage the best of each platform.
